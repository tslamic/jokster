# Jokster App :japanese_goblin: 

A simple joke-telling app demonstrating the very basics of [Dagger2](https://google.github.io/dagger/). :dagger:

## Motivation

[Dependency injection][1] or DI is a [25-dollar term for a 5-cent concept][3]. It means giving an object its instance variables. So instead of e.g. creating an `OkHttpClient` instance yourself: 


```kotlin
class ChuckApi {
  private val client = OkHttpClient()
  // ...
}
```

_inject_ it via a constructor: 

```kotlin
class ChuckApi(private val client: OkHttpClient) { 
 // ...
}
```

Voilà! You just performed a _dependency injection_. Simple, right?

</p>

One of the cornerstones of [object-oriented design][5] is the [Dependency inversion principle][4]. In essence, it focuses on _what_ the code does, and not _how_ it does it. Consider the following class:

```kotlin
class ChuckApi {
  fun tellJoke(): String {
    // returns a funny joke from the interwebs
  }
}
```

If another class relies on the `ChuckApi`, such as:

```kotlin
class Repo(private val api: ChuckApi) {
 // ...
}
```

then any changes to the `ChuckApi` most likely affect the `Repo`, too. Also, assuming `ChuckApi` requires a network connection, `Repo` might be difficult to test. Introducing an interface such as:

```kotlin
interface FunnyApi {
  fun tellJoke(): String
}
``` 

and having `ChuckApi` implement it: 

```kotlin
class ChuckApi : FunnyApi {
  override fun tellJoke(): String {
    // same as before
  }
}
```

but making the `Repo` depend on the interface, rather than a concrete class:

```kotlin
class Repo(private val api: FunnyApi) {
 // heavy use of the api here ...
}
``` 

gives us the ability to pass `Repo` any implementation of the `FunnyApi` interface. This makes testing easier and ensures `Repo` needs no code changes if various `FunnyApi` implementations are provided.

So, how do we pass `FunnyApi` instances to the `Repo` class? You guessed it - it's with dependency injection! 

## A vague intro to Dagger2

Dagger2 is a popular DI framework for Java, Kotlin and Android. To use it, first add it to the list of your dependencies in `build.gradle`:

```groovy
dependencies {
  implementation 'com.google.dagger:dagger:2.x'
  annotationProcessor 'com.google.dagger:dagger-compiler:2.x'
}
```

When using Kotlin, use `kapt` instead: 

```groovy
apply plugin: 'kotlin-kapt'

dependencies {
  implementation 'com.google.dagger:dagger:2.x'
  kapt 'com.google.dagger:dagger-compiler:2.x'
}
```

To provide dependencies, you need _modules_. Modules are classes with the `@Module` annotation, and methods annotated with `@Provides`:

```kotlin
@Module  
class NetworkModule {  
    @Provides fun providesHttpClient(): OkHttpClient = OkHttpClient()
}
```

Dagger will inspect the class, look at the return types of the annotated methods, and say: _I now know how to create these objects!_

Another method might need an `OkHttpClient` to create a dependency:

```kotlin
@Module  
class ApiModule {  
    @Provides fun providesFunnyApi(c: OkHttpClient): FunnyApi = ChuckApi(c)
}
```

Assuming Dagger knows about the `NetworkModule`, it knows how to create the `OkHttpClient` and therefore knows how to create an instance of `FunnyApi`. In cases where Dagger can infer all the necessary dependencies, you can use a shorter [`@Binds`][6] annotation:

```kotlin
@Module  
interface ApiModule {  
    // Equivalent to the ApiModule above, just shorter. 
    @Binds fun providesFunnyApi(api: ChuckApi): FunnyApi
}
```

To let Dagger create objects on your behalf, you need to add an `@Inject` annotation to your constructors:

```kotlin
class ChuckApi @Inject constructor(c: OkHttpClient) : FunnyApi {  
    // ...
}
```

_Components_ stitch multiple modules together:

```kotlin
@Component(  
    modules = [  
        NetworkModule::class,  
        ApiModule::class  
  ]  
)  
interface AppComponent {  
    fun inject(activity: MainActivity)
    fun client(): OkHttpClient
}
```

Note the `@Component` annotation, along with the list of modules it includes.

Dagger will generate a class called `DaggerAppComponent` implementing the `AppComponent` interface. To consume the dependencies, you need a `DaggerAppComponent` instance, which is typically created in an `Application` class:

```kotlin
class App : Application() {  
    private lateinit var component: AppComponent  
  
    override fun onCreate() {  
        super.onCreate()  
        component = DaggerAppComponent.builder()  
            .networkModule(NetworkModule())  
            .apiModule(ApiModule())  
            .build()  
    }
  
    fun component(): AppComponent = component  
}
```

You're now ready to consume dependencies. There are two ways to do it.

1. Use an `@Inject` annotation:

```kotlin
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {  
    @Inject lateinit var factory: JokerViewModel.Factory  
  
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {  
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)  

        // get the AppComponent instance, and invoke the 
        // appropriate inject method which will automatically
        // populate all @Inject fields.
        val component = (application as App).component()  
        component.inject(this)
    }
}
```

Note that the `inject` method is not magical, nor special. The name is merely a convention, we could easily call it `awesomeMethod4Realz`. The important bit is the parameter - `MainActivity`. Dagger will generate a class that knows how to populate all `@Inject` fields, and whenever `component.inject(this)` is invoked, the call will be propagated to a method looking like this:

```java
public static void injectFactory(MainActivity instance, JokerViewModel.Factory factory) {  
  instance.factory = factory;  
}
```

As you may have guessed, the `JokerViewModel.Factory` is created and provided by Dagger.

2. Call the appropriate accessor methods:

```kotlin
class MainActivity : AppCompatActivity() {    
    override fun onCreate(savedInstanceState: Bundle?) {  
        super.onCreate(savedInstanceState)  

        // get the AppComponent instance and invoke the getter.
        val component = (application as App).component()  
        val client = component.client()
    }
}
```
